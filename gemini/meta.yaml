    # Require today's constituent packages to have been built, allowing this
    # meta-package to be used for generating them all at once.
    build:

    - gemini_python {{ version }}
    - gemaux_python {{ version }}
    # - disco_stu {{ version }}  # needs updating to use git repo/tags
    # At install time, don't tie dependencies to today's date, allowing them to
    # be updated individually (the latest builds should be picked up anyway).
    # The meta-package must remain tied to a tag, however, in order to be used
    # for installing all the corresponding packages at once, so will need to be
    # removed when manually installing packages with mixed tags.
